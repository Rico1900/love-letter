My dearest \emph{[Her Name]}, 

中文

I have been trying to find the right words for something that has become wonderfully simple in my heart: I love you. Not as an idea, not as a moment, but as a steady truth I return to---in ordinary mornings, in quiet evenings, and in every small space between.

You have a grace that changes the atmosphere of a room. When life is loud, you bring calm; when it is heavy, you bring lightness; when it is uncertain, you bring a kind of courage that feels like home. I admire the way you care, the way you notice, the way you make beauty out of what others might overlook.

If I could give you one gift in return for all you are, it would be this: the certainty that you are cherished. Not only for what you do, but for who you are---your laughter, your tenderness, your strength, your mind, your patience, and even the soft, honest edges that make you human and real.

Thank you for building a life with me. Thank you for the thousand unseen kindnesses, for the forgiveness you offer, for the dreams you keep, for the love you practice like an art. I am proud to be your husband. I am grateful to be your friend. And I would choose you again, in any lifetime, in any version of the world.
